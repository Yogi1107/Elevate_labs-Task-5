# Titanic Survival Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset, which aims to uncover patterns and factors that influenced passenger survival during the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic.

---

## Objective

The goal of this project is to perform EDA using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to:
- Understand data distribution
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Visualize relationships between variables
- Summarize key findings in a PDF report

---

## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- FPDF (for generating PDF reports)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Insights

- **Gender (Sex)** had a major impact on survival: most survivors were **female**.
- **Pclass (Passenger Class)** strongly influenced survival rates, with 1st class passengers surviving more often.
- **Fare** and **Age** showed patterns related to socio-economic status and vulnerability.
- **Embarkation port** (Embarked) gave some additional insights into demographic groupings.

---

## Summary of Deliverables

- ✔️ Cleaned dataset free of missing/null values
- ✔️ EDA Jupyter Notebook with visualizations (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps)
- ✔️ PDF report summarizing all observations and insights

---

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-eda-project.git
cd titanic-eda-project
```

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Titanic_EDA_Notebook.ipynb
```

View the PDF Report:
Open Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf to view the final findings.

## Dataset Source
The dataset is based on the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle, widely used for machine learning and data science practice.
